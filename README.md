Quadrotor Model in Matlab/Simulink
==================================

This repository contains matlab and simulink files, used for modeling a quadrotor (Pelican) and designing LQR and PID controller for it. Version of matlab and simulink needed for this repository is 2021b. Results of this project is used to simulate a quadrotor in Gazebo and ROS enviroment in [this repository](https://github.com/siavash1999/rotors_simulator).
